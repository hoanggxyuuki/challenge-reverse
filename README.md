# Reverse Challenge

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Reverse Challenge**! This competition tests contestants on their skills in **Reverse Engineering** across various programming languages. It's an excellent opportunity to sharpen your analytical thinking and enhance your expertise in security and software engineering.

## Objective

The goal of the challenge is to analyze source code or binaries, uncover their internal logic, and meet the defined objectives. The challenges may include:
- Decryption/Decoding.
- Static code analysis.
- Debugging and dynamic analysis.
- Vulnerability exploitation.

## Rules and Guidelines

1. **Challenge Format**:
   - Each challenge will be presented as a binary, source code snippet, or encoded/obfuscated task.
   - Solve the task by reversing the logic and extracting the required output.

2. **Allowed Tools**:
   - You may use any debugging tools, decompilers, or programming languages to assist in your analysis.
   - Collaboration is not permitted unless explicitly stated.

3. **Submission**:
   - Submit your solutions in the required format (e.g., plain text, code, or detailed write-up).
   - Ensure your submission is clear, concise, and replicable.

4. **Scoring**:
   - Points will be awarded based on the difficulty of each task.
   - Bonus points may be awarded for creative or efficient solutions.

## Requirements

- Knowledge of programming languages (e.g., C, Python, JavaScript, etc.).
- Familiarity with debugging tools (e.g., GDB, IDA Pro, OllyDbg).
- Analytical and problem-solving skills.

## How to Get Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
